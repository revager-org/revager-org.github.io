<h1>Current State of Development</h1>

<p>With RevAger 1.4, we consider the development in its current form as finished. We do not plan any major releases in the future.</p>

<p><strong>A little note for software developers:</strong> In 2009, RevAger has been developed by three software engineering students during the beginning of their studies. Therefore, the code quality is surely not the best. Meanwhile, we have learned a lot and we would have done many things differently! :-) There was also the requirement, not to use any external libraries, so we solved a number of quite usual challenges using our own implementation.</p>

<h1 style="margin-top: 35px;">The Roots of RevAger</h1>

<p>Originally, the development of RevAger has been done by three software engineering students during the Software Engineering Student Project 2009 at the University of Stuttgart in Germany. The goal of this internship was to develop a software assistant in order to simplify the process of planning and conducting technical reviews. In cooperation with the <a href="http://www.iste.uni-stuttgart.de/se/" target="_blank">Software Engineering department at the University of Stuttgart</a>, the German company <a href="http://www.aeb.de/" target="_blank">AEB GmbH</a> was the customer within the whole project. Finally, we received an award for RevAger by the customers for creating the best product during the Software Internship 2009.</p>

<p>After successfully finishing the student project we decided to publish RevAger as open source software and to go ahead with the development. You can find more detailed information about how to contribute to the project on <a href="http://launchpad.net/revager" target="_blank">Launchpad.net (RevAger)</a>. We are looking forward to receiving any kind of feedback or other contribution! You can download RevAger for free and use it for your purposes individually.</p>
