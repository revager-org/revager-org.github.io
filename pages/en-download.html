<p>RevAger (Review Manager) is a platform-independent software application for organizing and conducting reviews and inspections in a professional way. The current version of RevAger is compatible with all operating systems using Java 6.</p>

<p><strong>A little note for software developers:</strong> In 2009, RevAger has been developed by three software engineering students during the beginning of their studies. Therefore, the code quality is surely not the best. Meanwhile, we have learned a lot and we would have done many things differently! :-) There was also the requirement, not to use any external libraries, so we solved a number of quite usual challenges using our own implementation.</p>
